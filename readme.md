# MyWorkout

## What is this repo?

#### This repo is my personal project, and as you can see in the image below, we have some lists of workouts that the user can explore. 
#### At the moment the project permite you to see the main bones, joints and muscles of the human body; that is cool, because probably any other aplication that is like a 'workout maker' don't shows the bones or joints with details in a workout plan. Well, anyway, posteriorly you will can make your workout, selecting exercises, setting your number of sets and reps, and finally generates a PDF or an Excel spreadsheet of it.

## What is my purpose?

I think the best thing I know how to do in my life is to train. I feel that i'm better at the gym than programmig. But i love the gym and i love to programming. So, my purpose here's to build a tool that can help other persons at the gym to train through the workouts maked by me or yourself. But of course, it's continues being just my personal project!
