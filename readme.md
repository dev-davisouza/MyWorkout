## What is my purpose?

I think the best thing I know how to do in my life is train. I feel that i'm better at the gym than programmig. But i love the gym and i love to programming. So, my purpose here's to build a tool that can help other persons at the gym to train through the workouts maked by me. But of course, it's continues being just my personal project!

## Technologies used:
For being straight, this tool serves to improve my skills at **full stack development**. Because this site is being developed using:
- **Django**;
- **Python**;
- **Sqlite3**;
- **CSS**;
- **HTML**;
